Here, the initial idea, was to develop a dummy website using Reactj plus NextJs...

During the development, I figured out about, how NextJs would work with Redux... So, I decided to try to implement it...
It costed to me a lot of time and research, but, finally I was able to make it work...

Then, I start to wonder about... how to make the page, kind static, and just change it's content...
So, I tried something  I would say bizarre... and started to pass the page component through the dispatcher...

If you want to take a look, please, clone it... run your favorite package manager, like yarn or npm, to install the dependencies... and good trip!
